# 🐧 Managing File Permissions and Access Control in Linux

**Date:** November 2025

### Project Overview

This project involved using **Linux commands** to manage and secure file and directory permissions within an organizational environment. I analyzed existing authorization levels using the `ls -la` command, interpreted permission strings, and applied **`chmod`** to modify access controls according to the **Principle of Least Privilege**.

Key tasks included removing unnecessary write access for public users, adjusting permissions for hidden files, and configuring directory access to restrict usage to specific accounts. These actions reinforced system security and ensured proper user authorization across files and directories.
